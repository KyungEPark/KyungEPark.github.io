About myself
------
Hi! I am glad that you decided to visit my personal page.
My name is Kyung eun Park. Trixie is my nickname that eases a lot of people to call and remember my name. You are free to decide which name you want to call me as. 

I come from South Korea, but have been living in Germany since fall of 2019. I am the second of four children, with fraternal twins below me, and a older sister who owns beautiful Maltese dogs.

You can always ask me anything you are curious about the two countries, and I will do my best to answer your questions.

In my free times, I enjoy a variety of hobbies that I sometimes cannot manage, including playing flute, singing and dancing, baking, drawing, and playing games. Traveling has been also in the list, but since COVID crisis in addition to the adult life flushing on me, my travel soul has not spread its wings.
My MBTI (Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator) is **ENTP**.


*Disclaimer: I should not rely too much on MBTI, being a researcher - but this is big in Korea :D*

My research interests
------
Like my hobbies, I also like to use different perspectives when it come to research. Currently, I am working on three thematically different topics, each having its own prestige.
You can read more about them in my working papers.
